# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It is used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (also called the dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables). The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear, meaning that changes in the predictor variables are associated with a constant change in the outcome.

In simple terms, linear regression models the relationship between the input features (independent variables) and the output (dependent variable) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The equation for a simple linear regression with one independent variable is:

``` math
   y=mx+b
```

- y is the dependent variable (the one you're trying to predict),
- x is the independent variable (the input feature),
- m is the slope of the line (how much y changes with a unit change in x),
- b is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is zero).

For a multiple linear regression with multiple independent variables, the equation becomes:
```math
 y=b0​+b1​⋅x1​+b2​⋅x2​+…+bn​⋅xn​
```

- y is the dependent variable,
- b0 is the intercept term,
- 1,2,…,b1​,b2​,…,bn​ are the coefficients of the independent variables 1,2,…,x1​,x2​,…,xn​.

The goal of linear regression is to find the optimal values for the coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. This is typically done by using a cost function, and the optimization process is often performed using techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, and engineering, for tasks such as predicting stock prices, sales forecasts, and understanding the relationships between variables. It serves as a foundational concept in machine learning and forms the basis for more complex models.
