# Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to the Machine Learning Playground! ðŸš€ This repository is my personal space to experiment and learn the ins and outs of machine learning. Here, you'll find a collection of code, notebooks, and projects as I journey through the fascinating world of ML.

## Table of Contents
1. [ Introduction ](https://github.com/anonymousknight07/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Introduction_to_Machine_learning.md)
2. [ Linear Regression ](https://github.com/anonymousknight07/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)
## What's Inside

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing hands-on exercises, tutorials, and experiments with machine learning algorithms.
    
- **Projects**: Real-world projects applying machine learning to solve specific problems or tasks. Each project comes with documentation and explanations of the methodologies used.(Coming Soon)
    
- **Code Snippets**: Useful code snippets, utilities, and helper functions that I find handy during my machine learning journey.
